 In the world, there are many good image labeling tools. -e.g. , ([Yolo_mark](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark), [BBox-Label-Tool](https://github.com/puzzledqs/BBox-Label-Tool), [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)).
 
 But... I reinvented it... I don't know why I made this.. You can call me idiot.
 
 When I labeld the Image using the existing programs, I am sooooooooooo bored...
 
 So I thought... Why this is fxxking so bored??
 
 Answer Was The Design...
