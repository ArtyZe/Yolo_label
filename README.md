 In the world, there are many good image labeling tools for object detection. -e.g. , ([Yolo_mark](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/Yolo_mark), [BBox-Label-Tool](https://github.com/puzzledqs/BBox-Label-Tool), [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg)). 
 
But... I reinvented it...
 
## WHY DID YOU REINVENTED THE WHEEL? ARE YOU STUPID?

 When I use the pre-existing program to annotate a training set for YOLO V3, I am sooooooooooo bored...
 
 So I thought about Why this is so fxxking bored??

 And I found that anwer.
 
 The answer is that pre-existing programs are not 'sensitive' 
 Baaaaam!
 
 See the below picture!
